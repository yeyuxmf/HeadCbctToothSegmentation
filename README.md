Head CBCT Tooth segmentation, STS3D2023 DataSetï¼ŒDeep Learnning

# Introduction
1. I have been engaged in CBCT segmentation based on deep learning for nearly ten years.
2. The STS3D2023 dataset has been annotated at the instance level for each tooth in all data (approximately 500 CBCTs).
3. We have trained CBCT on teeth, mandible, and neural tubes using the most advanced deep learning methods currently available, and can be said to have achieved the best results on the market.
